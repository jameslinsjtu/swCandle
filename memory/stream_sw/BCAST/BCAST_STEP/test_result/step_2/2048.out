STREAM version $Revision: 5.10 $
==================================================================
This system uses 8 bytes per array element.
==================================================================
Array size = 12595200 (elements), Offset = 0 (elements)
Memory per array = 96.1 MiB (= 0.1 GiB).
Total memory required = 288.3 MiB (= 0.3 GiB).
Each kernel will be executed 10 times.
 The *best* time for each kernel (excluding the first iteration)
 will be used to compute the reported bandwidth.
==================================================================
Your clock granularity/precision appears to be 2 microseconds.
Each test below will take on the order of 119336 microseconds.
   (= 59668 clock ticks)
Increase the size of the arrays if this shows that
you are not getting at least 20 clock ticks per test.
==================================================================
WARNING -- The above is only a rough guideline.
For best results, please be sure you know the
precision of your system timer.
