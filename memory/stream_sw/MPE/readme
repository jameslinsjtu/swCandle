1. how to measure L1:
	repeat large times of mem access successively with small size of array
2. how to measure MEM:
	make array size large, 240000000,eg.
3. how to measure L2:
	make L1 miss each time, while L2 hit, refer to KNC microbenchmark paper.
4. left to be done:
	besides the previous 3, need inst latency test, throughput test.
